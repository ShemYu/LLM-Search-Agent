# Description
`RAG-Engine-Template` is a foundational project template designed to harness the capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain. The primary goal of this repository is to provide a quick-start platform for projects that require RAG capabilities.

> `RAG` is a cutting-edge AI framework that retrieves facts from an external knowledge base, grounding large language models (LLMs) on the most accurate and up-to-date information. This not only enhances the accuracy of LLMs but also provides users with insights into the generative process of the model.
